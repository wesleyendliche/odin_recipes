    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds lean ground beef</li>
        <li>½ cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>¼ cup milk</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) envelope dry onion soup mix</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 (10.5 ounce) cans condensed cream of chicken soup</li>
        <li>¾ cup water</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) packet dry au jus mix</li>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, milk, and onion soup mix together in a large bowl until well combined; shape into 8 patties.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Dredge patties in flour just to coat, and quickly brown on both sides in the hot skillet. Place browned patties into the slow cooker stacking alternately like a pyramid.</li>
